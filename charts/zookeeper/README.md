# Zookeeper Helm Chart

Installs Zookeeper clusters atop Kubernetes.

## Introduction

This chart creates a Zookeeper cluster in [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. The chart can be installed multiple times to create Zookeeper cluster in multiple namespaces.

## Prerequisites

  - Kubernetes 1.15+ with Beta APIs
  - Helm 3.2.1+
  - Zookeeper Operator. You can install it using its own [Helm chart](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator/tree/master/charts/zookeeper-operator)

## Installing the Chart

To install the zookeeper chart, use the following commands:

```
$ helm repo add pravega https://charts.pravega.io
$ helm repo update
$ helm install [RELEASE_NAME] pravega/zookeeper --version=[VERSION]
```
where:
- **[RELEASE_NAME]** is the release name for the zookeeper chart.
- **[CLUSTER_NAME]** is the name of the zookeeper cluster so created. (If [RELEASE_NAME] contains the string `zookeeper`, `[CLUSTER_NAME] = [RELEASE_NAME]`, else `[CLUSTER_NAME] = [RELEASE_NAME]-zookeeper`. The [CLUSTER_NAME] can however be overridden by providing `--set fullnameOverride=[CLUSTER_NAME]` along with the helm install command)
- **[VERSION]** can be any stable release version for zookeeper from 0.2.8 onwards.

This command deploys zookeeper on the Kubernetes cluster in its default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Upgrading the Chart

To upgrade the zookeeper chart from version **[OLD_VERSION]** to version **[NEW_VERSION]**, use the following command:

```
$ helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] pravega/zookeeper --version=[NEW_VERSION] --set image.tag=[NEW_VERSION] --reuse-values --timeout 600s
```
**Note:** By specifying the `--reuse-values` option, the configuration of all parameters are retained across upgrades. However if some values need to be modified during the upgrade, the `--set` flag can be used to specify the new configuration for these parameters. Also, by skipping the `reuse-values` flag, the values of all parameters are reset to the default configuration that has been specified in the published charts for version [NEW_VERSION].

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the zookeeper chart, use the following command:

```
$ helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
