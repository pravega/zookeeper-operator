# Zookeeper Helm Chart

Installs Zookeeper clusters atop Kubernetes.

## Introduction

This chart creates a Zookeeper cluster in [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. The chart can be installed multiple times to create Zookeeper cluster in multiple namespaces.

## Prerequisites

  - Kubernetes 1.15+ with Beta APIs
  - Helm 3+
  - Zookeeper Operator. You can install it using its own [Helm chart](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator/tree/master/charts/zookeeper-operator)

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```
$ helm install my-release zookeeper
```

The command deploys zookeeper on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Zookeeper chart and their default values.
